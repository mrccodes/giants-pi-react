## Running the app

### Production

This app is created to run on a raspberry pi using Electron JS to run in kiosk mode. To get the app up and running on a pi you will need to:

- Clone the repo to your Pi
- cd into the project directory
- `npm run start:prod`

This will use a bash script to first build the Vite app for production.

Then, it will start up the SocketIO server which feeds the app temperature data about the Pi. This can be turned off by setting `VITE_PI=false` inside `.env.production`

Next, it spins up an Express server which used to retrieve Splash Hit data, as well as hosts the app.

Finally, Electron is started to render the now running Vite app.

### Development

To start the app for development:

- Clone the project to your local machine
- `npm install`
- `npm run start:dev`

This will start the Vite dev server in development mode. It uses flags in `.env.development` to turn on debug mode which logs extra data about failing mlb-api typechecks, and disables the Pi monitoring socket connection.

## ‚úÖ Testing

### Unit tests

`npm run test`: Run unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library

### End-to-end tests

1. `npm start`: Start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Run end-to-end tests with Cypress choosing one of the following options:

- `npm run cy:open`: Open Cypress in dev mode
- `npm run cy:run`: Execute Cypress in CLI

## üî¶ Linting

- `npm run lint`: Run linter
- `npm run lint:fix`: Fix lint issues
